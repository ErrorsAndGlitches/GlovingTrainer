# How To Set Up

The application is not very polished, but does what it fundamentally should. To upload a list of moves, create a file
called "gloving_moves.txt" and push it to the "/sdcard/" on the device.

# How to Use

There are two modes that will cause a new, random move to be shown:

1.  Speech Mode: A new move is generated by saying "Next"
2.  Timer Mode: A new move is generated every *N* seconds where *N* is the number in the number picker in the top right

# TODO

Create a move list editting UI because not everyone wants to use ADB :)
