# Android Gloving Application

This application is used to help glovers practice, hone their skills, and inspire creativity.

# How To Set Up

The application is not very polished, but does what it fundamentally should. To upload a list of moves, create a file
called "gloving_moves.txt" and push it to the "/sdcard/" on the device.

# TODO

Create a move list editting UI because not everyone wants to use ADB :)
